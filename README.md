# Finance-Performance-Dashboard
Hello Everyone,

I created this Finance Dashboard in Tableau using the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Unified Mentor.


Problem Statement

Organizations often face challenges in tracking and analyzing financial performance across multiple dimensions. Key metrics such as sales, profits, discounts, and trends over time must be visualized effectively to enable data-driven decision-making. Without such insights, it becomes difficult to identify profitable regions, optimize product performance, and manage discounts effectively.

The objective of this dashboard is to provide an interactive and visually engaging solution to track:

Sales and Profit by Country

Sales and Profit Trends Over Time

Gross Sales vs Discounts

Sales by Product and Discount Band

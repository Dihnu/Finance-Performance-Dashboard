# Finance-Performance-Dashboard
Hello Everyone,

I created this Finance Dashboard in Tableau using the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Unified Mentor.


## Problem Statement
The goal of this dashboard is to provide a clear and actionable visualization of key financial performance metrics. The dashboard will help stakeholders analyze trends, identify opportunities, and optimize strategies for improved financial outcomes. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Sales and Profit by Country**
   - Visualize total sales and profits across different countries to identify regional performance disparities.

2. **Sales and Profit Trend Over Time**
   - Examine how sales and profits evolve over time to detect patterns, seasonality, or anomalies.

3. **Gross Sales vs Discounts**
   - Understand the relationship between gross sales and applied discounts to evaluate the effectiveness of discount strategies.

4. **Sales by Product and Discount Band**
   - Explore sales distribution across different products and discount bands to uncover high-performing segments and evaluate pricing strategies.

## section in the report

###The report has multiple sections where you can manage the data, including the ability to slice the data by segments, country, and year to display specific information.

The report features cards showing Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sales, and Total Profit.

The data is visualized using different charts: Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, Line Graph, and Heat Map.

1.The Bar Chart has Country on the X-axis and Sales on the Y-axis.
2.The Scatter Plot has Gross Sales on the X-axis and Discounts on the Y-axis.
3.The Line Graph has Sales on the X-axis and Profit on the Y-axis.
4.The Heat Map displays Sales by Product on the X-axis and Discount on the Y-axis.

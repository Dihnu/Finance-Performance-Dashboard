# Finance-Performance-Dashboard
Hello Everyone,

I created this Finance Dashboard in Tableau using the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Unified Mentor.


## Problem Statement
The goal of this dashboard is to provide a clear and actionable visualization of key financial performance metrics. The dashboard will help stakeholders analyze trends, identify opportunities, and optimize strategies for improved financial outcomes. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Sales and Profit by Country**
   - Visualize total sales and profits across different countries to identify regional performance disparities.

2. **Sales and Profit Trend Over Time**
   - Examine how sales and profits evolve over time to detect patterns, seasonality, or anomalies.

3. **Gross Sales vs Discounts**
   - Understand the relationship between gross sales and applied discounts to evaluate the effectiveness of discount strategies.

4. **Sales by Product and Discount Band**
   - Explore sales distribution across different products and discount bands to uncover high-performing segments and evaluate pricing strategies.
